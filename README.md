![Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/kmoreno013/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-CNN/blob/main/creditcard.png)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, ultimately enhancing security and customer trust in financial systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud). It contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset includes features such as transaction amount, time, and several anonymized variables generated by PCA.

### Key Dataset Features:
- **Time**: Time elapsed since the first transaction in seconds.
- **V1 to V28**: Anonymized features obtained through PCA.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: Target variable (1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for non-fraudulent).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data cleaning and normalization.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Balancing the dataset using sampling techniques.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Built a CNN model using Keras with the following layers:
     - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
     - Batch normalization layers for stability.
     - Max pooling layers for down-sampling.
     - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
     - Dense layers for classification.
   - The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained the model using the training dataset over 25 epochs.
   - Utilized Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
   - Monitored training and validation accuracy and loss.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model on the test dataset using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualized the results using confusion matrix and learning curves.

## Results
The CNN model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately **93.91%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in fraud detection systems. By utilizing CNNs, financial institutions can significantly enhance their fraud detection capabilities, ultimately reducing losses due to fraudulent activities.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include:
- Exploring advanced architectures like LSTM or GRU for time-series analysis.
- Implementing ensemble methods for better performance.
- Utilizing more sophisticated data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
